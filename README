piratepack/README contains the version on the first line.

piratepack/src/main.c contains the source code for the piratepack binary

piratepack/src/setup contains files used by the installation script

piratepack/src/share contains files that will be used by the piratepack once

preparation.

The other files in the piratepack directory are standard files used to
configure and make the piratepack binary. They allow for the typical
./configure, ./make commands.


INSTALLATION SCRIPT (install_piratepack.sh)

Usage: install_piratepack.sh [base directory]

Note: The base directory is where most of the global piratepack files are
stored. The default base directory is /opt/piratepack. Call it "basedir".

The script installs the piratepack for all users. Assuming the dependency
requirements are met, it compiles all binary executables inside
piratepack/setup from source. The executables are placed in basedir/bin
(symbolic link).

The script adds a symbolic link /usr/bin/piratepack linking to basedir/bin/piratepack.

The script adds the line:
$basedir/bin/piratepack --refresh
to /etc/profile in order to keep piratepack updated for all users


AFTER INSTALLATION

When a user logs in, the command "piratepack --refresh" executes to update
or enable piratepack for the first time. Local piratepack files are stored in
$HOME/.piratepack

Executing "piratepack" loads the piratepack GUI. This allows a user to manually
enable/disable piratepack. piratepack can also be accessed from the gnome menu
if it was installed using the DEB file.

Tor Browser is also added to the menu if installed using DEB file. This is
actually Vidalia starting firefox with a user profile called "tor".

Firefox modifications are added to $HOME/.mozilla/firefox

$HOME/.polipo is added for use by polipo

$HOME/.vidalia is added for use by vidalia

A "Pirate" background theme is set on enabling piratepack
