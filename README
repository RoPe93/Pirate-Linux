INSTALLATION SCRIPT (install_piratepack.sh)

Usage: install_piratepack.sh [base directory]

Note: The base directory is where most of the global piratepack files are
stored. The default base directory is /opt/piratepack. Call it "basedir".

The script installs the piratepack for all users. Assuming the dependency
requirements are met, it compiles all binary executables inside
piratepack/setup from source. The executables are placed in basedir/bin
(symbolic link).

The script adds a symbolic link /usr/bin/piratepack linking to basedir/bin/piratepack.

The script adds the line:
$basedir/bin/piratepack --refresh
to /etc/profile in order to keep piratepack updated for all users


DEB BUILD SCRIPT

Usage: build.sh

This will create the main piratepack DEB package and place it into ../deb/


AFTER INSTALLATION

When a user logs in, the command "piratepack --refresh" executes to update
or enable piratepack for the first time. Local piratepack files are stored in
$HOME/.piratepack

Executing "piratepack" loads the piratepack GUI. This allows a user to manually
enable/disable piratepack. piratepack can also be accessed from the gnome menu
if it was installed using the DEB file.
